**Fresquito** is an ongoing project with the aim to display on a website the coldest and hottest town in Spain, in (almost) real time.

It used to be hosted locally on a Raspberry Pi at www.fresquito.es, but it's currently down because I'm refactoring the code and reviewing the overall structure of the project, relying more on dockerization rather than ad-hoc scripts.

The main datasource is also being revamped, switching from the unreliable ElTiempo.es to the quite more stable AEMET.
